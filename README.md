# Greenr

## 💡 Inspiration

We got inspired by the things around us which can be recycled but are thrown away and are eventually burnt or dumped into rivers which causes pollution and health problems not only to humans but to aquatic animals as well. We want to help people to reduce the amount of waste and to make the environment cleaner and healthier.

## 💻 What it does

Greenr is a web app where you can:

- Find that the object is recyclable.
- Find that the object is non-recyclable.
- Classify the objects in real-time.
- Get the notification email for the nearby recycling center.

## ⚙️ How we built it

- Figma: For design
- React Js: For frontend
- Tailwind CSS: For styling
- Tensorflow: For object detection

## 🌳 Best Environmental Hack
We created Best Environmental Hack as we made use of machine Learning for an environmental cause like recycling of products. With our app you can find the object which is recyclable and non-recyclable in real-time and then get an email for nearby recycling center.

## 🤝 Most Creative Use of GitHub

We are using GitHub for the following reasons:

- Collaboration: GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration.
- GitHub Project: We also used GitHub for **planning and keeping track** of our project and its progress with the help of the GitHub project management tool.
- Implementing the CI/CD workflow: GitHub makes it easy to implement the **CI/CD workflow** and makes the deployment process easy.
- Deploying the project: Deploying the project on GitHub helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people.
- Using PRs and Issues: We are doing multiple **PRs** and building multiple **Issues** to keep on track of the project.

## 🌐 Best Domain Name from Domain.com

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Due to the difference in the time zone it was a bit difficult to collaborate but we managed to get the project done in time. Complete the project in the given time frame.
- None of the teammates were good at ML, we had to do a lot of research while working on the project.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the project in the given time frame.
- Implementing the Object Detection and Classification model.

## 📖 What we learned

- Collaboration with other developers.
- How to work with Tensorflow.js for object detection.

## 🚀 What's next for Greenr

- Making a mobile app.
- Improving the accuracy of the model
